# Yolo Container Orchestration with Kubernetes

This repository demonstrates how to orchestrate a containerized application using Kubernetes. Kubernetes provides powerful tools for deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications in a cluster environment.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to deploy and manage your containerized application using Kubernetes:

1. **Set Up Kubernetes Cluster:**

   Start by setting up a Kubernetes cluster. You can use Minikube for local development or cloud provider- Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).

2. **Define Kubernetes Resources:**

   In the `k8s` directory, you'll find YAML manifests that define various Kubernetes resources:

   - **Deployments:** Define the desired state of your application pods.
   - **Services:** Expose your application internally or externally.
   - **ConfigMaps and Secrets:** Manage configuration and sensitive data.
   - **Persistent Volumes and Claims:** Handle persistent storage.

3. **Deploy Your Application:**

   Use `kubectl apply -f <filename>.yaml` to deploy the defined resources. Start with deployments, services, and other necessary resources for your application.

4. **Scale and Manage:**

   Use `kubectl get`, `kubectl describe`, and `kubectl logs` to monitor and manage your application. Adjust replicas in deployments to scale your application up or down.

5. **Updating Your Application:**

   Update your application by modifying the deployment YAML files and applying the changes using `kubectl apply`.

6. **Cleaning Up:**

   When you're done, delete the deployed resources using `kubectl delete -f <filename>.yaml`.

## Directory Structure

- `k8s/`: Contains YAML manifests for Kubernetes resources (deployments, services,configmaps.).
